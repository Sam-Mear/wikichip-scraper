# Wikichip scraper

In progress, is for [SpecDB](https://specdb.info/) so they're not stuck manually entering data.

Why did I make this its own seperate repo rather than a fork? IDK.

You need BS4, this can be installed with `pip install beautifulsoup4`

If SpecDB ever included ECC memory support the scraper has this information as
'has ecc memory support'

## TODO:
* include XFR stat
* include Chipsets in the inherit
* Make starting file(ie. Vermeer.yaml (vermeer-inherit and the vermeer folder gets made.))
* APU specs
